# Rotterdam Schools Synthetic Control analysis

Reproducible code archive for NPRZ impact assessment study

## Preprocessing
The preprocessing scripts can be run all at once by running the file `01_run_preprocessing.R` from the main directory.

```r
RScript run_preprocessing.R
```

In RStudio, you can use a "Job" for this.

This should take about 1 hour 45 minutes.

Each of the preprocessing steps in the folder `preprocessing_scripts` can also be run independently.

## Synthetic control

The scripts 02-06 run and inspect the synthetic control method.
